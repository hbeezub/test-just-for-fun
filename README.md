adding a test repository to my account. 

My Name is Heidi Beezub.  I am a first year Grad student.  My BA is in Business Administration from Mercyhurst (College in 1987). 
Additionally I earned a Secondary English Education Certification from Edinboro University in 1994 (I hated student teaching).  I
currently work part time for the VA Medical Center as a Managerial Cost Accountant (MCA) Program Analyst.  
My main goal with the Data Science program is to obtain some programming skills & hopefully sharpen & learn new analysis 
abilities.
